Happy new year and happy new year objectives!!!

I've been thinking a lot about what should I aim
to achieve this year. While I would like to give a shot at dekstop applications with GTK4 and Rust,
I think I should finish (This time really) my Android app.

I worked for some time on an Android (Flutter) app with a Rust written API Rest server. I actually
published the app and it's available on the Google Play Store as an open beta, but I should finish it...

Here is the thing, I enjoyed a lot doing the backend with Rust, but on the Frontend part... Is not 
that I don't enjoy writting Dart code, is that my design skills are not good enough... I'm crossing my
fingers to get some contributors at some point later this year once I refactor the code, fix bugs, clean it up
and publish the app as finished.

PD: You can find the app here: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alosarjos.backlogger)

See you soon :)
