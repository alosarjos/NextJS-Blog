title: "Getting Rusty with GTK"

So, I've been looking into a new project to work on my spare time.

I would actually like to contribute somehow to the Gnome community to be honest, but right now my
skills with DE stuff are pretty much non-existential. But I think it's actually a good moment to 
get started making my very first GTK desktop app. While I'm not an expert and I still have a long
way to go, I like Rust and it has received first class support from the GTK developers. Right now
the GTK Rust combo looks like a good place to start working on. 

I found that [Bilal Elmoussaoui](https://twitter.com/bil_moussaoui) has a 
[GTK4 + Rust + Flatpak template repository](https://gitlab.gnome.org/bilelmoussaoui/gtk-rust-template)
which are basically all the cool kids desktop appication words of choice :)

Still, for a getting started template, it's.... quite a thing too. Support for PO multilang files, flatpak, 
meson, rustfmt pre-commit hooks... Don't get me wrong, all of this is amazing, and I'm sure it's really helpful 
for those knowing what they are doing, but maybe too much at once for someone who just wants to make a basic app 
(So much that my VSCode rust-analyzer just gets stuck). 

Still for these cases, there is the **ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC TUTORIAL** for 
[GUI development with Rust and GTK](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/introduction.html), 
that I intent to use as reference to know what the hell I'm supposed to do.

Hoping I can show something more than a Hello World for next week.

See you soon :)
