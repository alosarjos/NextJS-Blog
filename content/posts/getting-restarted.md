This week is one of those that changes life completely. I've been lucky enough to find a new job.

If you told me about this day some years ago, I would have laughed. In the same way I can't believe how good
is GNU/Linux nowadays for gaming, I can't believe I'm working as a PHP/Symfony backend
developer.

Thank god PHP is **not** what it used to be and the way I learned it from the old PHP 5 days, and 
Symfony makes lots of things even easier, but at the same time, the amount of labels of complexity
added to current software feels kinda high to be honest. I'm still getting around it and I'm 
absolutely sure that all these things fixes more issues than they create, but just for getting
started, trying to have running on my dev machine the project I will work on, it's not only the 
challenge of getting the ways and the ropes of how people work and their methodology, is learning
orchestration, advance use of containers, there are like multiple environment config files and then the last thing is the actual framework!

From the devops standpoint I'm pretty sure this is heaven, but as a newcomer to Web dev, this
definitely feels way more complex than it needs to be. But who knows, maybe I get to learn all
this tech and I will end up changing my mind in the same way I did about ending up working as a
PHP backend developer.

See you soon :)
